          Data is the foundation for the platform that we are building. A
          platform that will empower employee decision-making, highlight
          exceptional companies and give insight into what really matters.
        </p>

          We are looking to validate our belief that people have a desire to
          share their experiences and that from these experiences new data can
          be uncovered.
