        We see technology as a powerful tool for accountability and inspiring
        action. By using open-ended questions and machine learning, we aim to
        illuminate and extract valuable data from even the most ambiguous
        aspects of workplace cultures. By shining a light on the ambiguous "grey
        areas‚Äù in a workplace we can create a new set of rules where everyone
        should be treated with equal respect and fairness.

        By 2030, Generation Z will constitute over 30% of the workforce,
        bringing with them a strong preference for diversity and inclusion.
        Research shows that 83% of Gen Z workers prefer to work for companies
        with diverse teams; and 74% believe that companies should create more
        inclusive environments.
