      <h1>Our vision</h1>
      <p>
        We created Torch to have a space that will show what it's truly like to
        work somewhere, not just for the majority but for everybody.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will ask thoughtful, open-ended questions to encourage people to
        share their experiences in their own words. With machine learning, our
        hypothesis is that we reveal patterns and insights that might otherwise
        remain hidden.
      </p>

      <p>
        We see technology as a powerful tool for accountability and inspiring
        action. By shining a light on the ambiguous, "grey areas‚Äù in a workplace
        we can create a new set of rules where everyone should be treated with
        the same equal respect and fairness, regardless of their background.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, our goal is to provide an honest depiction of workplaces,
        through robust data we will empower people to make informed decisions
        and inform organisations on how to cultivate safe, inclusive, and
        thriving work cultures.
